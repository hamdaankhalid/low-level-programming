Being self taught sucks when you realize you dont just want to code on top of software...
but actually build your software your own frameworks, your own OS, your own DB. Low level
programming becomes the barrier to entry. This won't be the case with me, I will thrive in
the face of every layer of abstraction I go beneath.
